Note
----

live-boot is moving from a monolithic script into a proper
plugin architecture for better maintenance and customization.

Additionally, this will allow us to abstract initramfs-tools
integration to also support other initrd generators, such as
dracut.

Unfortunately, from a developers point of view, we could not
finish this in time for wheezy, but we will finish this for
jessie. Please excuse the sorry state of the 9990-* scripts.
From a users point of view, it doesn't matter at all though.


Scripts overview
----------------

0xxx	live-boot internals

1xxx	find and mount rootfs

2xxx	find and mount persistence

3xxx	anything after that involves read or write access to the rootfs

9xxx	FIXME
