  * Pass debian-installer/locale to /root's debconf db (closes: Malone
    #41896).
  * Identify ourselves as casper when communicating with debconf.
  * Factor out preseeding code into casper-preseed; this knows that it only
    needs to register a question if it fails to set it, which saves memory
    by avoiding debconf having to rewrite templates.dat.
  * Preseed kbd-chooser/method as well as debian-installer/keymap, so that
    kbd-chooser run from ubiquity picks up the selected keyboard (closes:
    Malone #42202).
  * Use new dpkg-reconfigure --no-reload option (debconf 1.4.72ubuntu6) to
    avoid needlessly rewriting templates.dat.
